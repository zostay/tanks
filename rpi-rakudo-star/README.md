# Rakudo Star for ARM

This should probably go into a separate repo, but for now I'm putting it here.
I build here a 32-bit ARM version of Rakudo Star to avoid the hassle of
configuring a Raspberry Pi to do it. It can be done. I've done it for 2019.03 on
Raspberry Pi Zero. However, it's slow, requires reconfiguring the Pi's memory
blah blah. It's easier to just build it somewhere else and pull onto the Pi.
